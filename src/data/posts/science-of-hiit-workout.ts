            "I don't have time to exercise."
        </p>
        <p>
            It is the most common excuse in the world. We think a "real" workout takes an hour. We think we need to drive to the gym, change clothes, run on a hamster wheel for 45 minutes, and shower. Who has 90 minutes to spare?
        </p>
        <p>
            Enter **HIIT** (High-Intensity Interval Training).
        </p>
        <p>
            The promise of HIIT is seductive: Get the benefits of a 60-minute jog in just 15 minutes. It sounds like an infomercial scam. But the science says it is real.
        </p>

        <h2>The Protocol: Sprint, Rest, Repeat</h2>
        <p>
            Traditional cardio is "Steady State." You run at 60% effort for a long time.
            <br>HIIT is "Spikes." You go at **100% maximum effort** for a short burst (e.g., 30 seconds), then rest completely (e.g., 30 seconds). Repeat.
        </p>
        <p>
            The magic is in the intensity. You have to push your heart rate to 85-95% of its max. You have to be gasping for air. If you can talk, you aren't doing HIIT.
        </p>

        <h2>The Afterburn Effect (EPOC)</h2>
        <p>
            If you jog for an hour, you burn calories for an hour. Once you stop, the burning stops.
        </p>
        <p>
            HIIT triggers a metabolic state called **EPOC** (Excess Post-exercise Oxygen Consumption).
        </p>
        <p>
            Because the intervals are so violent, your body incurs an "Oxygen Debt." It consumes huge amounts of cellular resources. To recover, your body has to work overtime *after* the workout is finished.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The Result:</strong> Your metabolism stays elevated for up to 24 hours after you leave the gym. You are burning fat while you sit on the couch watching Netflix.
        </p>

        <h2>Mitochondrial Density</h2>
        <p>
            Mitochondria are the power plants of your cells. They turn fuel into energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we age, our mitochondria die off. We feel tired. We gain weight.
            <br>Research shows that HIIT is arguably the best way to stimulate **Mitochondrial Biogenesis** (growing new power plants). A study found that older adults who did HIIT increased their mitochondrial capacity by 69%, essentially reversing cellular aging.
        </p>

        <h2>Sample Workouts (No Equipment Needed)</h2>
        <p>
            You don't need a treadmill. You just need gravity.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The Tabata Protocol (4 Minutes Total):</strong>
            <br>This is the most famous HIIT study.
            <br>• 20 seconds: Sprint/Burpees (MAX effort).
            <br>• 10 seconds: Rest.
            <br>• Repeat 8 times.
            <br>Warning: These will be the longest 4 minutes of your life.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The 30/30 Split:</strong>
            <br>• 30 seconds: Jump Squats.
            <br>• 30 seconds: Rest.
            <br>• 30 seconds: Pushups.
            <br>• 30 seconds: Rest.
            <br>• Repeat for 15 minutes.
        </p>

        <h2>The Dangers</h2>
        <p>
            HIIT is a drug. The dose matters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because it places massive stress on your Central Nervous System (CNS) and joints, you cannot do it every day. Your cortisol (stress hormone) will spike, and you will crash.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Do HIIT 2-3 times a week. On the other days, walk, do yoga, or lift heavy weights slowly. Treat HIIT like the spice, not the main course.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Efficiency is the currency of the modern world. HIIT allows you to buy health for a discount. It hurts. It is uncomfortable. But it is over quickly, and the interest it pays on your biological bank account is massive.
