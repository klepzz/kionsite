        <p>
            Biology is technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think about it. A cell is a factory. DNA is the software code (A, T, C, G). Proteins are the hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
            For millions of years, evolution was the only programmer. It was slow and random.
            <br>Now, humans have taken the keyboard. Welcome to **Synthetic Biology** (SynBio).
        </p>
        <p>
            This isn't just GMOs (modifying a tomato). This is engineering new organisms from scratch to do things nature never intended.
        </p>

        <h2>Brewing Medicine Instead of Beer</h2>
        <p>
            You know how yeast eats sugar and poops out alcohol? That is fermentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Geneticists have hacked yeast. They deleted the "Make Alcohol" code and pasted in the "Make Insulin" code.
            <br>Today, most of the world's insulin is grown in giant steel vats of yeast. No pigs required.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are now doing this for everything.
            <br>• **Malaria Cure:** Scientists engineered yeast to produce Artemisinin (an anti-malarial drug).
            <br>• **Perfume:** We engineered yeast to produce Rose Oil. It smells exactly like a rose, but no flowers were harvested.
        </p>

        <h2>Meat Without the Cow</h2>
        <p>
            Livestock farming is destroying the planet. It uses massive amounts of water and land.
        </p>
        <p>
            SynBio offers an alternative: **Lab-Grown Meat**.
            <br>You take a muscle stem cell from a cow (harmless biopsy). You put it in a nutrient broth. You tell it to "Divide."
            <br>The cells multiply into muscle tissue. It is biologically identical to steak. No slaughterhouse. No methane.
        </p>
        <p>
            Companies like Impossible Foods use SynBio to make "Heme" (blood protein) from plants, making their burgers bleed and taste like iron.
        </p>

        <h2>DNA Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            We are running out of space to store data. Hard drives are bulky and fail after 10 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            DNA is the ultimate hard drive. It is incredibly dense and lasts for thousands of years.
            <br>Scientists have successfully encoded all of Shakespeare's sonnets into a strand of DNA.
            <br>In theory, you could store the entire internet in a shoebox full of DNA vials.
        </p>

        <h2>The Jurassic Park Problem</h2>
        <p>
            If we can read/write DNA, can we bring back the dead?
        </p>
        <p>
            Companies like Colossal are actively working to "de-extinct" the **Woolly Mammoth**. They are editing Elephant DNA to add hair, fat reserves, and cold tolerance.
            <br>The goal? To reintroduce enormous grazers to the Arctic tundra to stop the permafrost from melting (Climate Change mitigation). It sounds insane. It is happening.
        </p>

        <h2>The Danger: Biosecurity</h2>
        <p>
            Computer code can have viruses. Biological code can have viruses... literally.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tools to edit DNA (CRISPR) are becoming cheap. You can buy a kit online.
            <br>What happens when a college student accidentally creates a super-flu in their garage? What happens if a terrorist designs a pathogen that targets specific genetic markers?
            <br>Biosecurity is the biggest threat of the 21st century. We are lowering the barrier to entry for God-like powers.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Synthetic Biology is the Industrial Revolution of our time. We are moving from the Information Age to the **Biological Age**. We are no longer just living on the Earth; we are learning to edit the source code of life itself.
