            You can watch David Attenborough documentaries all your life. But nothing prepares you for the sound.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a low, constant rumble that you feel in your chest before you hear it. It is the sound of 1.5 million wildebeest, 200,000 zebras, and 300,000 gazelles moving as one living organism.
        </p>
        <p>
            The **Great Migration** is not an event; it is a cycle. It is an endless, clockwise circle of life and death across the Serengeti (Tanzania) and the Maasai Mara (Kenya).
        </p>

        <h2>The Cycle of Survival</h2>
        <p>
            The animals are following the rain. They are chasing the sweet, calcium-rich grass that babies need to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>January - March (The Birthing Season):</strong>
            <br>In the southern Serengeti (Ndutu), the herds stop. In a span of 3 weeks, 400,000 calves are born.
            <br>It is cute. It is also a buffet. Every predator in Africa knows this schedule. Cheetahs teach their cubs to hunt here. Hyenas patrol the perimeter. It is beautiful and brutal.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>April - June (The Rut):</strong>
            <br>The rains end. The ground dries up. The herd begins to move north. This is mating season. The noise of half a million testosterone-fueled bulls grunting is deafening.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>July - October (The River Crossings):</strong>
            <br>This is the main event. To get to the green grass in the north, the herds must cross the **Mara River**.
            <br>The river is swollen. And it is infested with Nile Crocodiles—dinosaurs that can grow up to 16 feet long. The wildebeest gather on the banks, terrified. Then, one jumps. Then ten. Then thousands. It is chaos. It is the most dramatic 20 minutes of nature you will ever see.
        </p>

        <h2>The Big Five</h2>
        <p>
            While the Migration is the star, the supporting cast is legendary. The Serengeti is home to the "Big Five": Lion, Leopard, Elephant, Buffalo, and Rhinoceros.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Lion Prides:</strong> The Serengeti has the largest population of lions in Africa. You will see them sleeping on the *Kopjes* (granite rock islands) that rise out of the grass.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Cheetahs:</strong> The open plains are a sprinter's paradise. Watching a cheetah go from 0 to 100 km/h in 3 seconds to take down a gazelle is physics in motion.
        </p>

        <h2>Where to Stay: Canvas vs. Concrete</h2>
        <p>
            You can stay in a fancy lodge with a swimming pool. But to feel the pulse of the wild, you should stay in a **Mobile Tented Camp**.
        </p>
        <p>
            These camps move with the migration. There are no fences. You sleep under canvas. You hear the lions roaring at night. You wake up, unzip your tent, and see a giraffe eating the tree next to you. It is luxury, but it is wild.
        </p>

        <h2>The Balloon Safari</h2>
        <p>
            If you splurge on one thing, make it this.
            <br>You wake up at 4:00 AM. You drive into the dark bush. You climb into a basket.
            <br>As the sun rises over the horizon, turning the sky violent orange and purple, you float silently over the plains. There is no engine noise; just the occasional blast of the burner.
        </p>
        <p>
            From 1,000 feet up, the herd looks like oil poured over the landscape. You see the patterns. You see the scale.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The Maasai named it *Siringit*—"The place where the land runs on forever." They were right. The Serengeti makes you feel small. It reminds you that the world doesn't belong to us. We are just visitors.
