    <p>One of the most popular health trends of recent years, Intermittent Fasting (IF), is actually as old as human history. Before refrigerators, our ancestors were forced to eat this way. So why does modern science support this ancient practice? Here is everything you need to know about Intermittent Fasting.</p>

    <h2>What is Intermittent Fasting?</h2>
    <p>IF is concerned more with <strong>when</strong> you eat than what you eat. It is based on the principle of eating during specific hours of the day and letting the body rest for the remainder. Water, tea, and coffee (sugar-free/milk-free) are allowed during this fasting window.</p>

    <h2>How Does It Work? Cellular Cleaning</h2>
    <p>When we eat, the body is busy with digestion and storage. In a state of hunger, it switches to "maintenance and repair" mode. After about 12-14 hours of fasting, the body consumes the sugar in the blood and starts burning fat for energy.</p>

    <h3>The Miracle of Autophagy</h3>
    <p><strong>Autophagy</strong>, the discovery that won the 2016 Nobel Prize in Medicine, kicks in during prolonged fasting. The body "eats" damaged or dysfunctional cell parts and converts them into energy. This is a massive internal cleaning that delays aging and protects against diseases.</p>

    <h2>Popular Methods</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>16:8 Method:</strong> Splitting the day into 8 hours of eating and 16 hours of fasting. (e.g., Eating between 12:00 - 20:00). It is the most sustainable method.</li>
        <li><strong>5:2 Diet:</strong> Eating normally for 5 days of the week and consuming very low calories (500-600) for 2 days.</li>
        <li><strong>OMAD (One Meal A Day):</strong> Eating only one single meal a day (23 hours fasting). It is advanced level.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scientific Benefits</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Weight Control:</strong> Both calorie intake drops because you eat fewer meals, and metabolic rate increases.</li>
        <li><strong>Insulin Resistance:</strong> Provides protection against Type 2 diabetes by lowering blood sugar levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Brain Health:</strong> Fasting increases the BDNF hormone in the brain, which supports neuron growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Heart Health:</strong> Studies exist showing it lowers bad cholesterol (LDL).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Who Should Be Careful?</h2>
    <p>It may not be suitable for everyone. Pregnant women, those with a history of eating disorders, those taking diabetes medication, and growing children should not practice it without consulting their doctors.</p>

    <p>Intermittent fasting is a powerful tool that adds discipline and health to your life. Instead of constantly filling your body with fuel, give it time to burn what's in the tank and repair itself.</p>
