            Margaret Thatcher famously said, "Sleep is for wimps." She slept 4 hours a night. (She also died suffering from severe dementia).
        </p>
        <p>
            We live in a culture that wears sleep deprivation like a badge of honor. We brag about "hustling" and drinking 5 espressos.
        </p>
        <p>
            But Matthew Walker, the world's leading sleep scientist, puts it bluntly: <em>"The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Sleep is not a passive state where your body shuts down. It is an active state where your body heals, and more importantly, where your brain takes out the trash.
        </p>

        <h2> The Glymphatic System: The Night Janitor</h2>
        <p>
            For centuries, we didn't know *why* we slept. We just knew we died without it.
            <br>In 2013, scientists discovered the **Glymphatic System**.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is what happens: When you enter deep sleep, your brain cells literally shrink by 60%. This opens up wide channels between neurons. Then, Cerebrospinal Fluid floods through your brain like a power washer.
        </p>
        <p>
            It flushes out metabolic waste, specifically a sticky protein called **Beta-Amyloid**.
            <br>Why does this matter? Beta-Amyloid buildup is the primary cause of Alzheimer's Disease.
            <br>If you don't sleep, the trash builds up. Night after night, year after year, the plaque accumulates until the lights start going out. Sleep is your brain's self-cleaning cycle.
        </p>

        <h2>REM Sleep: The Emotional First Aid</h2>
        <p>
            We sleep in 90-minute cycles. At the end of each cycle, we enter **REM** (Rapid Eye Movement). This is dream sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
            During REM, your body is paralyzed (so you don't act out your dreams), but your brain is 30% *more* active than when you are awake.
        </p>
        <p>
            What is it doing? It is processing emotion.
            <br>Walker compares REM sleep to "Overnight Therapy." The brain takes the painful memories of the day and strips away the bitter emotional coding. It allows you to remember the trauma without feeling the visceral pain.
            <br>This is why "sleeping on it" actually works. You wake up with a clearer, calmer perspective.
        </p>

        <h2>The Memory Save Button</h2>
        <p>
            The Hippocampus is the part of the brain that stores new memories (like a USB stick). It has limited storage.
        </p>
        <p>
            During deep sleep, the brain transfers these memories from the temporary storage (Hippocampus) to the permanent hard drive (the Cortex).
        </p>
        <p>
            If you study all day and then pull an "all-nighter," you lose about 40% of what you learned. The save button was never pressed. Sleep is not the enemy of productivity; it is the engine of learning.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Sleep Better (Science-Backed Tips)</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Darkness:</strong> We are sensitive to blue light (screens/LEDs). It blocks Melatonin (the sleep hormone). Turn off screens 1 hour before bed.</li>
            <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Your body core temperature needs to drop 2-3 degrees F to initiate sleep. Keep your room cold (around 18°C / 65°F).</li>
            <li><strong>Regularity:</strong> Go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time. Even on weekends. Your Circadian Rhythm craves routine.</li>
            <li><strong>Caffeine:</strong> Caffeine has a "half-life" of 6 hours. If you have a coffee at 4 PM, half of it is still in your brain at 10 PM. Stop caffeine by noon.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Sleep is the single most effective performance enhancer known to man. It makes you smarter, happier, healthier, and better looking ("beauty sleep" is real). It is free. And it is available tonight.
