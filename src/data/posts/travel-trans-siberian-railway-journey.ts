            We are addicted to speed. We want to get there *now*.
        </p>
        <p>
            The **Trans-Siberian Railway** is the antidote.
        </p>
        <p>
            It runs from Moscow to Vladivostok.
            <br>Distance: 9,289 kilometers.
            <br>Time Zones Crosses: 8.
            <br>Time: 7 days (non-stop).
        </p>
        <p>
            It is the Iron Ribbon that holds Russia together. Taking this train isn't a commute; it is an expedition. It forces you to understand the sheer, terrifying scale of the Earth.
        </p>

        <h2>Life on the Train</h2>
        <p>
            You enter a bubble. The outside world ceases to exist.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are three classes:
            <br>• **1st Class (Spalny Vagon):** Two beds, private, luxuriously boring.
            <br>• **2nd Class (Kupe):** Four beds. You share with strangers. Comfortable.
            <br>• **3rd Class (Platskartny):** An open dorm carriage with 54 beds. No doors. Feet everywhere. Smells like sausage and tea.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Take 3rd class. This is where the life is. You will meet grandmothers (Babushkas) who will feed you pickles. You will meet soldiers, students, and workers. Communication happens via Google Translate and smiles.
        </p>

        <h2>The Provodnitsa</h2>
        <p>
            Every carriage is ruled by a **Provodnitsa** (The Carriage Conductor).
        </p>
        <p>
            She is usually a stern woman in a uniform. She controls the Samovar (the hot water boiler). She checks your tickets. She glares at you if you are too loud.
        </p>
        <p>
            But if you respect her rules (and buy a tea glass), she will protect you like a mother bear. She is the Captain of the ship.
        </p>

        <h2>The Rhythm: Eat, Sleep, Look</h2>
        <p>
            There is no wifi (mostly). There is nothing to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            You fall into a trance. The "ka-chunk, ka-chunk" of the wheels becomes your heartbeat.
        </p>
        <p>
            You look out the window.
            <br>Day 1: Urban Russia. Factories.
            <br>Day 2: The Ural Mountains. The border between Europe and Asia.
            <br>Day 3-4: The Taiga. Endless birch trees. Endless snow (in winter). Wolf country.
            <br>Day 5: **Lake Baikal**. The jewel. It contains 20% of the world's fresh water. The train tracks hug the shoreline for hours. It is breathtaking.
        </p>

        <h2>Platform Life</h2>
        <p>
            The train stops for 20 minutes in random towns with names like Omsk, Tomsk, and Perm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone rushes out to the platform.
            <br>Local Babushkas are selling homemade food: *Pirozhki* (stuffed buns), smoked fish (Omul), berries, and instant noodles.
            <br>You buy food for the next leg. You breathe the freezing air. Then the whistle blows, and you scramble back on board.
        </p>

        <h2>The Mongolian Divergence</h2>
        <p>
            Many travelers switch tracks at Ulan-Ude and take the **Trans-Mongolian**.
        </p>
        <p>
            This route cuts south through the Gobi Desert to Beijing.
            <br>The landscape shifts from Siberian forest to rolling steppes, then to desert. You see Gers (Yurts) and camels. It is arguably the most diverse visual journey on earth.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Why spend a week in a metal box?
        </p>
        <p>
            Because looking out that window cleans your brain. It is "Slow Travel" in its purest form. You watch the planet change slowly. You realize that the world is big, and your life is small.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you finally step off in Vladivostok (or Beijing), you feel like you stepped off a spaceship. You have survived the void. And you will miss the "ka-chunk."
