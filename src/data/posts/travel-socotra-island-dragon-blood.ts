            There is weird. And then there is **Socotra**.
        </p>
        <p>
            Located off the coast of Yemen in the Indian Ocean, this island has been isolated from the mainland for 18 million years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Isolation breeds evolution.
            <br>Just like the Galapagos, Socotra went its own way. **37% of its plants, 90% of its reptiles, and 95% of its land snails exist nowhere else on Earth.**
        </p>
        <p>
            When you land here, you feel like you have left the planet.
        </p>

        <h2>The Dragon's Blood Tree</h2>
        <p>
            This is the icon. The alien.
        </p>
        <p>
            The **Dracaena Cinnabari** looks like a giant green mushroom or an umbrella turned inside out.
            <br>Why does it look like that? Evolution. The shape allows the tree to capture moisture from the morning mist and channel it down to the roots. It provides its own shade to stop the water from evaporating.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you cut the bark, it bleeds a thick, dark red resin. The ancients called it "Dragon's Blood." It was used as a dye for Stradivarius violins, a medicine for gladiators, and for magic rituals. Standing in a forest of these trees is a surreal experience.
        </p>

        <h2>The Bottle Tree</h2>
        <p>
            Then there is the **Desert Rose** (Bottle Tree). It looks like a bloated elephant leg with pink flowers on top. It stores water in its massive trunk to survive the brutal summer. It anchors itself into bare rock. It is ugly-beautiful.
        </p>

        <h2>Blue Water, White Sand</h2>
        <p>
            It's not just the trees. The beaches here rival the Maldives.
        </p>
        <p>
            **Detwah Lagoon** is a magical stretch of white sand and turquoise water. Stingrays glide in the shallows. Pufferfish swim around your ankles.
        </p>
        <p>
            **Shuab Beach** is accessible only by boat. As you sail there, pods of hundreds of spinner dolphins jump alongside the boat. The water is so blue it looks dyed.
        </p>

        <h2>The Culture: The Soqotri</h2>
        <p>
            The people here have their own language (Soqotri), which is unwritten and dates back to the ancient Semitic roots. They are fishermen, herders, and poets.
        </p>
        <p>
            The culture is incredibly hospitable. You will be offered Chai (tea) with goat milk and immense amounts of flatbread.
            <br>It is a hard life, but a peaceful one. The conflict on the mainland of Yemen feels a world away.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Get There (The Challenge)</h2>
        <p>
            Socotra is not easy.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is basically one flight a week (usually from Abu Dhabi or Cairo). You need a visa. You need a local guide (you cannot explore alone).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Accommodation:</strong> Do not expect the Ritz. You will be camping. You will sleep in a tent on the beach. You will shower with a bucket. You will eat fresh fish caught an hour ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is **Raw Travel**. It is uncomfortable, dusty, and hot.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            If you are tired of resorts, if you are tired of seeing the same viral spots on Instagram... go to Socotra.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a reminder that the Earth is still wild. It is a living museum of what the world might have looked like millions of years ago. Go before it changes.
