            Imagine you are a history teacher. You want to teach your students about the Roman Colosseum.
        </p>
        <p>
            Option A: You ask them to open page 42 of the textbook and look at a grainy photo.
            <br>Option B: You hand them a headset. Suddenly, the walls of the classroom dissolve. They are standing on the sand of the arena in 80 AD. The crowd is roaring (audio spatialization). A Gladiator walks past them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Which student is going to remember the lesson?
        </p>
        <p>
            **Virtual Reality (VR)** is not just for gaming. It is the holy grail of education: **Experiential Learning**.
        </p>

        <h2>The Retention Problem</h2>
        <p>
            The "Cone of Learning" suggests that we remember:
            <br>• 10% of what we read.
            <br>• 20% of what we hear.
            <br>• **90% of what we do**.
        </p>
        <p>
            VR hacks this system. Because the brain perceives the VR simulation as a spatial reality, it stores the memory as an *experience*, not just information. It triggers the hippocampus (spatial memory).
        </p>

        <h2>Impossible Field Trips</h2>
        <p>
            Budget cuts have killed the field trip. VR brings it back, on steroids.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Science:</strong> Students can shrink down to the size of a blood cell and float through the human artery, watching red blood cells carry oxygen.
            <br><strong>Geography:</strong> They can stand on the edge of a volcano in Iceland or dive into the Great Barrier Reef to count fish.
            <br><strong>Space:</strong> They can walk on the surface of Mars, looking back at the pale blue dot of Earth.
        </p>

        <h2>Safe Failure: Medical & Technical Training</h2>
        <p>
            For medical students, practicing surgery is high-stakes. You can't make mistakes on a live patient. Cadavers are expensive and static.
        </p>
        <p>
            VR allows "haptic" surgery. A student can perform a heart transplant 100 times in VR. They can feel the resistance of the tissue (force feedback). They can mess up, kill the virtual patient, reset, and try again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Walmart uses VR to train employees for Black Friday crowds. Pilots have used flight simulators for decades. Now, that level of training is available to everyone.
        </p>

        <h2>The Empathy Machine</h2>
        <p>
            Chris Milk famously called VR an "Empathy Machine."
        </p>
        <p>
            You can read about the refugee crisis. But putting on a headset and sitting in a tent in a Syrian refugee camp, making eye contact with a child, changes you. It breaks down the "us vs. them" barrier.
        </p>
        <p>
            Schools are using VR to fight bullying. You can experience a scenario from the victim's perspective. It builds emotional intelligence (EQ) faster than any lecture.
        </p>

        <h2>The Obstacles</h2>
        <p>
            If VR is so great, why isn't it in every school?
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Cost:</strong> Headsets like the Meta Quest 3 are affordable, but buying 30 of them for a class is still $15,000.
            <br><strong>Content:</strong> We need more high-quality educational software, not just "tech demos."
            <br><strong>Motion Sickness:</strong> Some students get nauseous.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The classroom of 1920 looks almost identical to the classroom of 2020. Rows of desks. A board at the front.
        </p>
        <p>
            VR breaks this industrial model. It turns students from passive consumers of information into active explorers. It brings the wonder back to learning. And in a world of distraction, wonder is the only thing that keeps us watching.
